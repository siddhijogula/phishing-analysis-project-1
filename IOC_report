IOC Report — RBFCU Azure-Hosted Phishing Site

Status: Completed
Date: (Add today’s date)
Analyst: Siddhi Jogula
Techniques: Credential Harvesting, Brand Impersonation
Tools Used: VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLScan.io, OSINT

1. Executive Summary

This investigation analyzes a live credential-harvesting phishing website hosted on Microsoft Azure Web Services. The page impersonates Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) and aims to trick users into submitting their banking credentials.

The website performs multiple HTTP transactions, interacts with cloud/CDN infrastructure, and uses a legitimate TLS certificate issued by Microsoft Azure to appear trustworthy. No malware payloads were distributed — the objective is purely credential theft.

6. Threat Assessment

Severity: High
Primary Technique: Credential Harvesting

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
T1566.002 – Spearphishing via service
T1583.003 – Cloud Infrastructure Abuse (Azure)
T1071 – Application Layer Protocol (HTTPS)
T1036 – Masquerading (fake banking login page)

Why It’s Effective
Trusted Azure subdomain → looks legitimate
HTTPS padlock → increases victim trust
Banking brand impersonation
No malware → harder for AV tools to flag

7. Recommended Defensive Actions
For Organizations

Block domains & IPs at network perimeter
Add IOCs to SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel)
Increase monitoring of Azure-hosted phishing sites
Train users on financial-themed phishing attempts
Enforce MFA for banking/financial access

For End Users
Do not enter credentials into unsolicited login pages
Verify URLs manually
Enable multi-factor authentication

8. Skills Demonstrated

Sandbox URL investigation
Static & dynamic URL analysis
IOC extraction (IPs, domains, URLs)
Threat classification
SOC-style reporting
Web traffic behavior analysis
